This being my first blog post, I will tell why I chose this project and how I worked on the proposal for the same. My proposal was based on the ideas list of Ceph, that is **Making Teuthology Friendly**. Teuthology is the testing framework for Ceph, and the project is to create a REST API for the same so that the developers don't have to go through the steep learning curve of Teuthology.

### Searching An Organization
Initially while searching for an organization to contribute to, I tend to filter them based on the programming language I'm well versed with. This year, it was `Python` & `Go` and based on this I got a few selected organizations, with Ceph being one of them. Once I started going through the ideas list of these organizations, I searched projects related to my field of interest and things I had experience in. After going through a lot of projects, I ended up with Ceph as it had a project based on `FastAPI`, which is a library I've used a lot and built multiple projects with.

### Writing A Proposal
I started off by looking through the source code of Teuthology and looking at the modules whose endpoints are to be created in the API. After talking with the mentors, the endpoints for `suite`, `schedule` and `kill` were to be created.

The mentors had given us 3 tasks, which were:

* Setup & run the current implementation of API on our local machines
* Write tests for the current routes
* Create UI/UX mockups for [Pulpito](https://pulpito.ceph.com/)

For writing the tests, I used `pytest` and mock data for routes such as `/login`. After completing these tasks, I started compiling all ideas I had in a word document. In the initial proposal, I included:

* How I aim to implement the API and which libraries I intend to use
* How I will write tests and use `pre-commit` checks
* How I will use automated testing and CI/CD using `GitHub Actions`
* Some basic mockups for Pulpito

I took reviews from the mentors, and asked for past GSoC proposals from a friend of mine and the person selected by Ceph in 2022. A big thanks to them, their proposals helped me a lot to frame mine. I explained everything in more detail, made better mockups and made a API workflow flowchart to visualise what I was aiming for.

I took multiple reviews from the mentors and my friends before finally submitting the proposal, and I'm very thankful to all of them. Writing this proposal wouldn't be possible without their help.

For reference, my proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tVmPS5XPE2iMnNBeYbZi0NBOo3_Am3fXE_maIwV5_MQ).

### Next Steps
According to the given GSoc timeline, from May 4 to May 28 we have the community bonding period, in which I will go through the documentation of Ceph, Teuthology and Pulpito. I'll also talk with the mentors and other Ceph community members in order to know what things would they like in the new version of Pulpito. I do have my end semester examinations, but I will have to manage it at the same time.

I will also work on my frontend skills, brushing up the HTML, CSS & Javascript that I know till now.
